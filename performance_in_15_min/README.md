PostgreSQL Performance in 15 Minutes
====================================

Talk on making PostgreSQL perform well for Django, given at DjangoCon 2015.

Written in Remark.js.  This presentation requires a local webserver to view; 
I suggest running:

     python -m SimpleHTTPServer
     
... in the directory of the talk.

Yes, I know the CSS is terrible.  I'm not a web developer, and this is my first 
Remark.js presentation.  Pull requests welcome.
