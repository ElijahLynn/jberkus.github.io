Why database configuration is less than 20% of performance

    go_faster = 1
    The layer cake
    Incremental improvement

Connection Pooling

    pgbouncer
    transaction pooling
    routing

Use Recent PostgreSQL

    'nuff said

Avoiding Bad Hardware

    Can't outperform it
    IO is more important than you think
        AWS notes
    Get enough RAM
    OS tips:
        don't use windows/mac
        avoid bad linux kernels
        no ext3!

More Cloud Stuff
   
    PAAS != Performance
    Load balance to read slaves
    check appserver distance

Stupid Stuff Your App Does

    Asking for data you already have
    Polling the database with small/no wait
    Join Loops
    Idle transactions

PostgreSQL.conf

    shared_buffers
    work_mem
    effective_cache_size
    wal_buffers
    checkpoint_segments
        checkpoint_completion_target
    maintenance_work_mem = higher (256MB?)
    AWS:
        random_page_cost = 1.5


do less
    get less data
        caching
        polling
        data you have
        data you don't need
        join loops
    resource-hungry queries
        slow queries
        idle transactions
