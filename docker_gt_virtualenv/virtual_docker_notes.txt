Docker > virtualenv

virtualenv is great
        run different versions
        test environments
        document requirements

except
        doesn't do different versions of python
        doesn't do c libs
        doesn't integrate well with scripts/tools
                (startup script example)
        accidentally clobbering paths
        not very sharable
                each person has to build
                implicit requirements
                
what's docker?

virtualenv | docker | vmware

advantages over virtualenv
        different versions of python
        c libraries
        scripts/tools just work
        no worries about paths
        simulate production
        test in different envs.
        sharing!
                docker hub

disadvantages
        mac OS
        sharing files is annoying
        way more disk space
