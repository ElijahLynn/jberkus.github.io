### Automating Postgres

---

![patroni saint image](patron_saint.png)

### Patroni

---

## What's Patroni?

A daemon which automates PostgreSQL replication
and failover,
running as PID 1 in each container.

---

## Where's Master?

![where's waldo](wheres_waldo.jpg)

* replicas need to know
* applications need to know

---

## Postgres Problems

* node identity
* replication connections
* master connection
* storage persistence
* shard identity

---

## Node Identity

![tagged elephant](tagged_elephant.jpg)

* monitoring
* special replicas

---

### Replication Identity

#### 10.40.0.3

### Replication Identity

---

## IP Address Woes

* pods can move
* IP reuse
* no continuity
* special replicas
* master connections

---

## Replication Slot Woes

```
slot_name | active | Kb_lag
----------+--------+-------------
10.40.0.1 | t      | 11
10.40.0.2 | t      | 9
```

---

## Replication Slot Woes

```
slot_name | active | Kb_lag
----------+--------+-------------
10.40.0.1 | t      | 20210
10.40.0.2 | t      | 4
10.40.0.3 | t      | 3
```

10.40.0.1 | t      | 1420021
10.40.0.2 | t      | 5
10.40.0.3 | t      | 472203
10.40.0.4 | t      | 301766
10.40.0.5 | t      | 201192
10.40.0.6 | t      | 8725
10.40.0.7 | t      | 3
```

## Replication Slot Woes

```
FATAL:  could not receive data
from WAL stream:
FATAL:  requested WAL segment
000000060000047C0000001F
has already been removed
```

---

## Workarounds

* failovers (lost nodes, data)
* custom proxies (lag)
* custom discovery (duplication)
* headless services (lost connections)
* cleanup processes (overhead)

---

### Without Statefulset

---

## Storage Issues

* can't reclaim storage
* exclusive access to PVs

---

## Storage Workarounds

* DaemonSet Abuse
* in-app volume management

---

### Sharding

---

#### StatefulSet Solutions

---

![statefulset diagram](new_diagram.png)

---

## Components

1. Etcd cluster
2. Headless service
3. StatefulSet of Replicas
   <br />running patroni
4. Master-only service
5. PVC for PetSet (optional)

---

## PV or Not PV?

* Big Database: PV
* Small Database: EmptyDir()

Big == takes too long to copy

---

## Flaws

* persistent database connections
* connection speed

---

## WIP Postgres Work

* Sharded Postgres (CitusData)
  <br />next week
* MM Replication (alpha)
  <br />next week
* Complex replication topologies

---

#### Still WIP<br />Kubernetes Work

---

## Affinity/Anti-Affinity (1.5)

* no two databases
* no two replicas
* hard vs. soft rules

---

## StatefulSet Federation (1.6?)

* groups of replicas
* different datacenters

---

## IO reservation (???)

* IOPS?
* Throughput?

---

## Reclaim Policies (???)

* scaling down should discard PV
* don't want to reuse corrupt data
* might not want old data
* would be nice to use HostPath

---

## Shadow Shards

![shadow shards](shadow_shards.png)

---

## Shadow Shards

* assignment
* replacement
* anti-affinity
