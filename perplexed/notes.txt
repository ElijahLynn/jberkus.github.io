  - unify Greek & Jewish Philosophy
  - map for the middle ages

Docker?
  - then what are these other things?

Everything you know about containers is wrong
  - no such thing as containers
    - combo of namespaces & cgroups
  - add lots of other stuff
    - like legos
    - explain the legos

Images and Containers
  What's an image?
  - tarball + metadata
  - packages
  - layers & sharing
  Image formats
  - Docker
  - OCI
  - rkt
  Build images
  - docker build
  - buildah, rkt
  Share Images
  - registries
    - docker hub
    - google, quay
    - CentOS, Fedora
  Install Images
  - local cache
  - docker pull
  - skopeo
  Run images
  - Docker daemon / Containerd
  - Rkt / SystemD
  - OCI + Systemd
  - CRI-O

From one to many

  Deploying to a Cloud
  - not just on your computer
  - on many computers
  - many times
  - called "orchestration"
  Container OS
  - want a smaller, more immutable OS to run containers on
  - should have container support and nothign else
  - Atomic, CoreOS, RancherOS
  Orchestration
  - run many containers over many machines
  - Kube, Swarm, Mesos, Nomad, etc.
  - Scheduler: runs containers on various servers based on resources
  - API server: takes requests from users & servers
  - Agent: runs actions on servers
  - DCS: stores state of cluster
  - plugins for storage & networking (see below)
  Networking
  - Containers need to talk to each other
  - Out of the box, containers have no network addresses
  - need to fake a network address by manipulating kernel (iptables etc.)
  - different tools work at different levels, can be combined
  - Docker libnetwork, flannel, weave, calico, openvswitch, etc.
  Discovery
  - need to find containers in a network by name/purpose/port
  - various tools, some DNS-based, some not
  - CoreDNS, SkyDNS, linkerd, istio, DockerDNS, Consul
  Storage
  - need to store persistent data
  - should somehow be associated with the container
  - possibly needs to move
  - Docker Volumes, Kubernetes Persistent Volumes, Mesos Persistent volumes
  - otherwise uses the storage you know
    - network storage (NAS)
    - local storage
    - clusters like Gluster, Ceph, ECS

Hosted Solutions, CaaS and PaaS
  - Hosted: run containers in the cloud
  - CaaS: run containers in the cloud
  - PaaS: push code to create containers and run in the cloud
  Examples:
    GKE: CaaS
    OpenShift: PaaS/CaaS
    Amazon CS: CaaS

Stuff I didn't cover
- monitoring
- tracing
- CI/CD tools
- API tools###
