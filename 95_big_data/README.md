9.5 Big Data
=================

Talk on the big data features coming in version 9.5.  Given at Indy Big Data meetup,
and possibly elsewhere.

Written in Remark.js.  This presentation requires a local webserver to view; 
I suggest running:

     python -m SimpleHTTPServer
     
... in the directory of the talk.

Yes, I know the CSS is terrible.  I'm not a web developer.  Pull requests welcome.

Thanks

To Magnus Hagander, Satoshi Nagasayu and Keith Fiske for some of the examples and text about the various features.
