Great Stats

SciPy is Awesome
    stats functions
    significance
    graphs

PostgreSQL is Awesome
    scalability
    concurrency engine
    primitive stats

Two Great Tastes That Taste Great Together
    pl/python
        what's a PL?
        how to install
            limitations
        adding in scipy

Why bother?
    the round-trip issue
    windowing---
    correlations

Putting it together
    ad-hoc analysis
    wouldn't it be great if ...
    supporting stuff
        arrays
        hstore
        custom aggregates
        windowing queries
        materialized views
        PostGIS

Examples
    stats over public data
    chi square over public data
    custom circular percentile
    stats by geography
    pregenerate graphs window function
