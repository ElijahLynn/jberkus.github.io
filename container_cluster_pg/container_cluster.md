## PetSet / StatefulSet

Kubernetes API for stateful applications,
introduced in 1.4 (still alpha)

* storage
* routing
* identity
* persistence

---

#### Why Containerize?

---

## Pro-container

* easy install/configure
* service encapsulation
* prevent "hot-fixes"
* ease of dev and testing
* orchestration

---

## Pro-orchestration

* auto-vivification
* deploy & configure in groups
* manage routing
* built-in HA/DR
* self-service for devs
* manage everything in one place

---

_manage PostgreSQL<br />as a cluster ecosystem,<br />instead of as<br />a bunch of servers_

---

## Anti-container

* extra setup
* change admin, config, monitorning tools
* possible performance issues
* no efficiency benefit for databases
* _everything is alpha_

---

This is your _future_ infrastructure.

---

#### Enough Talking,<br />Let's See Some Code!

---

## Prototypeishness

* still working on some of the alpha features
* some productions examples exist already (Spilo)
* others in ~~ 6 months

### Bots Not Cattle

### Autopilot Pattern

---

## Bots/Autopilots

Each containerized application is programmed
using a simple state machine
to be an intelligent part of a clustered
ecosystem.

---

## Container Considerations

* log to stdout/stderr
* need bootstrap script
* install config, hba
* set up initial users

---

## PV or Not PV?

* Big Databases: want persistent volumes
* Small Databases: use ephemeral storage, make lots of replicas.

---

#### Productionizing

---

## Add to Patroni/Citus

* Persistent Volume configs
* Vault support
* Sidecar containers (backup, admin)
* Failover for query node
* Failover for shards

---

## More Clusters!

* Postgres Pro MM Clustering
* BDR (with Federation?)
* PostgresXL

---

## Waiting for Kube

* Union ConfigMap
* Federated StatefulSets
* Node Affinity (1.5)
* Fix issues (PVs, etc.)
* Vault plugin
