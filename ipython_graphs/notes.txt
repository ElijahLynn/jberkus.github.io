    doing graphs by libreoffice
    crashed all the time
    incorporating new stats took hours
    
iPython to the rescue
    what notebook is
    how it works
    advantage for interactive graphing

    mix and match
    bit of a mess

Pulling from the database
    psycopg2
    converting to array

Graph Examples
    re-do the bar chart
    some pie charts
    stacked line graphs
    heat map
