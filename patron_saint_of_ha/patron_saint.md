#### Demo

---

## PG Replicaton is Awesome!

* Easy to set up
* Guaranteed
* Corruption-free
* Anti-footgun
* Combines with DR

---

![y u no guy](y_you_no_failover.png)

### Y U No Failover?

---

#### "Automated failover is too complicated.  You don't want it."

---

#### NO!

---

## Hard != Impossible

_general_ autofailover is prohibitive

but ... we can implement common use cases

---

## The 80% Solution

1. Pool of async replicas
2. Cheap/replacable nodes
   <br />VMs/Containers
3. Watchdog service
4. Auto-promote one replica
5. Other nodes remaster
6. Update routing

## Now, a little history ...

![handyrep logo](handyrep.png)

---

## Handyrep

* master-controller architecture
* based on Python Fabric + SSH
* worked in production
* worked with any Postgres config
* pluggable

www.handyrep.org

---

## Handyrep: _too general_

* Difficult to install
* Difficult to debug
* Over 100 configuration options
* Scaled poorly
* HR server was SPoF

---

## Zalando

* no1 European online fashion
* 15m customers
* 150 databases
* 24/7/365 operation

... needed automated, decentralized HA

---

## Failover Failure

---

![compose.io announcement](compose_governor.png)

---

## Compose Governor

* Containers
* Etcd-based consensus
* Simple PostgreSQL controller

... so we forked it.

### What about split-brain?

![split brain](split_brain.jpg)

---

## Etcd

* distributed consensus HTTP data store
* Raft algoritm
* implements CA
* great for config + metadata
    * not for data data

---

## Etcd Alternatives

* Zookeeper
    * larger scale
    * supported
* Consul
    * integrates discovery
    * not yet suppported

---

### Distributed consensus

![consensus](distrib_consensus_1.png)

### Net-split prevention
